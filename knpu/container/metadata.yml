title:  Journey to the Center of Symfony: The Dependency Injection Container
summary: |
    Let's not just *use* Symfony, let's conquer it! In this series, we're
    going to rip open the code that builds and boots Symfony's Container
    to see how it really works. Yes, this is geeky, and yes it's sweet!

    Besides the occassional [dinosaur](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Amazing_Stories_June_1926.jpg),
    expect to do the following on our adventure:

    * Debug that code that boots Symfony's Kernel
    * See how Symfony *builds* the container (woh)
    * Learn about the ContainerBuilder
    * Learn how DependencyInjection Extension classes work (i.e. the guys who process all that `config.yml` stuff)
    * Discover existing compiler passes and create your own
