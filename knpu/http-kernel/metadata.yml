title:  Journey to the Center of Symfony: HttpKernel Request-Response Core
summary: |
    Let's not just *use* Symfony, let's conquer it! In this series, you and
    I will journey to the center of Symfony by ripping open the source code,
    adding debug statements and seeing what *really* happens between the
    request and the response. It's as geeky-awesome as it sounds.

    [Besides dinosaurs](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Amazing_Stories_June_1926.jpg),
    expect to do the following on our adventure:

    * Create an event listener that does amazing things
    * Step through the `HttpKernel::handle()` method that's used in Symfony and Drupal 8
    * See where event like `kernel.request`, `kernel.response` and others are dispatched
    * Learn about request attributes and the magic they give us
    * Find out what a sub-request and how to handle it
    * Create your own sub-request manually

    This series will be fully published by **Dec 12th**! Woot!
